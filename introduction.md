# Will Code For Coffee

My name is Robby, and this is my fancy new digital playground. For those of you who are geeky enough, you'll find the information about what this monster is built on down below. There's a good bit of other stuff here, too.

## Technical Details

So, I'm sure the majority of visitors here will be intested in my IT competencies, since that's generally what a portfolio website is for. Let's hop right in with a look at what this application is, because it's not just another HTML site.

Don't get too excited. I'm not giving you any more detail beyond what you'd get from a simple Nmap scan, at best. I might like showing off my skills, but I also don't like making the black hats' job easier... I'd make it impossible... if that were only possible.

The development stack is Python, and the content markup is primarily HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript. Except for, well, the actual text on the pages. I'm always been a fan of Markdown, because it means that I can still read a document in plain text as if it had all the formatting still there. WikiPedia does a similar thing with their articles. Anywho, there's a tool in my stack that converts .md files to HTML. I'm using Flask to host the Python program, and serving it with Gunicorn. My data sources are in JSON and database sources. I'm a big fan of SQL (and I'm picky about ANSI standards!) and have spent a good amount of time playing with databases for a variety of things over the years. I have plans to explore the Azure Cosmos DB in the future, but that will be after I complete my Azure DevOps Engineer certification.

I'm not terribly worried about a security compromise, though, becasue this whole thing is running in a Docker container on Microsoft Azure. I've configured a separate resource group with very stringent policies, all configured to inherit down through the hierarchy. I'm very fond of the security model Azure employs... and of how efficient Azure DevOps is for managing the whole shabang. I mean, it really does simplify the construction of pipelines. There's an article somewhere in this site--if you dig enough, Seeker!--that I wrote detailing the setup of your Azure pipeline from source to production, that I use as a sort of cheatsheet. I've shared it with others a handful of times and have been told it's been beneficial.

## Other Tech Talents

Just because this monstrosity is running on my personal favorite in terms of platforms and development environments does not mean that I won't use others! In fact, I enjoy learning new technologies. Over the years, I've had exposure to:

- Various programming languages: C#, PowerShell, VisualBasic, PHP, Bash, C/C++, sed, awk
- Several programming libraries: DotNet, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, NumPy, Node.js, Bootstrap, React, etc
- Administration of multiple environments: Windows and Linux, with LAMP/WIMP and MEAN stacks, MS-SQL and MariaDB, Microsoft Sharepoint, Changepoint Daptiv
- Cloud administration and engineering on Microsoft Azure and AWS, as well as construction of private clouds from the ground up using OpenStack (open source version of IBM OpenShift)
- Network administration, with exposure to subnetting, virtualization, and common networking protocols (DNS, DHCP, HTTP/S, FTP/S, SMTP, SNMP, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, SSH, etc.)
