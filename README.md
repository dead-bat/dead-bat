## An Implementation of my Professional Website for GitHub

Thanks to a cool hack, I'm able to extend the content of my professional website to GitHub. The website itself is still in staging; you can check it's progress [here](http://wcfc.azurewebsites.net). If you want to build your own GitHub custom profile, the way I've done this, create a repo who's name matches your username (letter for letter, case and all), you'll be able to do the same thing with your README.md file.

I'm not great at formalities and small talk so I'm just going to build this out as I have the opportunity. I intend to use this and additional .md files to mirror my website right here in GitHub. The content will be kept in appropriate subdirectories to match the organization of the website.

One of the most important tools (other than technical prowess) for ~~hackers~~ IT people is social networking. I've often been told that an active presence on LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub comprise the holy trinity of a basic web presence. So before we go any further, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robby-emslie/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codes_4_coffee/), too. Good? Good. Let's get started....
