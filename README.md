# Will Code For Coffee!
## A Personal Portfolio Project

...And also my GitHub splash page thanks to a cool hack. If you create a repo who's name matches your username (letter for letter, case and all), you'll be able to do the same thing with your README.md file.

I'm not great at formalities and small talk so I'm just going to build this out as I have the opportunity. I intend to use this and additional .md files to mirror my web app portfolio/CV right here in GitHub, too (they'll probably be kept within the appropriate subdirectories for various components of this project; I dunno, it's a new project--I barely have a clear picture of what I want at this point).

One of the most important tools (other than technical prowess) for -hackers- IT people is social networking. I've often been told that an active presence on LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub comprise the holy trinity of basic internet presence. So, before we go any further, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robby-emslie/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codes_4_coffee/), and while you're already here, why not connect with me [here](https://github.com/will_code_for_coffee), too. Good? Good. Let's get started....
