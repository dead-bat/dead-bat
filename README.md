# Hail, and well met!

Since this is my personal GitHub profile, I can only assume you're here because you want to see what I'm up to. Maybe you found me on [LinkedIn]('https://www.linkedin.com/in/robby.emslie'), or maybe we've met in person. In any case, I can assure you of a few things:

- I'm about as disorganized as any geek you'll ever meet -- all I ask is that you do not judge the mess and don't try to clean it up. While it seems like there's no rhyme or reason to what you see, believe me: **I know exactly where everything is**. One day, I might even do some housekeeping. :-)
- None of the repos attached to this profile are "active" projects. A small portion of them are here just for storage, until they get moved to private repos; most of them are here as a "portfolio" of past work. That means that you'll see very little activity here. If you want to see some of my active projects, you'll need to reach out and ask me what I'm doing. Don't worry -- I don't bite!

And, finally, if you're interested in roping me into a new project, or offering me a job, or simply getting a cup of coffee, please feel free to reach out. I generally welcome new challenges as learning experiences, and am well into my second decade as a professional geek. Some of the technologies I am particularly proficient with inclue:

- Python
-- Web development with Flask
-- Data analytics and modeling
- Ruby
- Automation
-- Workflow, data, and process automation
-- Workato
-- n8n
- Web development
-- HTML/CSS and a little JavaScript
-- WordPress CMS

## Wish List

I maintain a "wish list" of opportunities based on technologies I'm looking to delve into. These include...

1. Python - I always want to learn more about Python, and discover new ways to make it do cool stuff
2. AI/ML - Anyone wanna use ChatGPT to solve your problems? I do!
